# Read me for my CV Project

Hi, so this Repo contains details of my own azure CV which I created following project video from the awsome  A Cloud Guru site

## First steps

- Front end folder contains website
- main.js contains the visitor counter code

## Highlights of other actions

- Created a Blob storage in Azure
- Created Azure Functions 
- Created a Counter which connects to the CosmoDB and triggers a function when the page is accessed
- Hooked up the backend API to the frontend webpage so counter displays
- Deployed static site to an Azure blob container
- Setup Azure CDN for HTTPS and custom domain support so my Website can be made available on my domain :)
